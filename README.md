# Design Patterns in Java

### This code was made with the aim of understanding and developing design patterns 

**Design Patterns** are consolidated solutions for currently 
problems in development. They are classified by:
* **Creational Patterns;** 
  * **Singleton**: Allows the creation of one class instance, providing global access to it;
* **Behavioral Patterns;**
  * **Strategy:** Simplify the algorithms variations to resolve one single problem;
* **Structural Patterns.**
  * **Facade:** Provides an interface that reduces the complexity in the integration with subsystems.
